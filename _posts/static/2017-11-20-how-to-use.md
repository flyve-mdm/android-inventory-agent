## Welcome to Flyve MDM!

Here we'll be explaining everything you need to know to start using your Inventory Agent.

The Android Inventory Agent features a complete inventory of your Android devices where both hardware and software information is collected.

You will be able to view and share your inventory in a JSON or XML file format.

## 1. Server configuration

After you [install the app](http://flyve.org/android-inventory-agent/howtos/installation), you must define the server address and credentials where the inventory will be sent in the Global Settings section.

With the Inventory parameters you can automatize the inventory generation, here you'll decide how your inventory will be run if manually or automatically, and the frequency it will have.
